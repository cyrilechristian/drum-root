## Installation

To get it working, you need to install all the dependencies. And the best way to do this is through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

To get started, make sure you have either of the package manager, [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) installed and working on your machine.

> To install the packages through npm, run the command

    npm install

> To install the packages through yarn, run the command

    yarn add

**_NOTE_**: In the rest of the documentation, you will come across npm being used for running commands. To use **_yarn_** in place of **_npm_** for the commands, simply substitute npm for yarn. Example, `npm start` as `yarn start`. For more help, checkout [migrating from npm](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)
